## What Have I Done:
I've made this hand tracking program using Python. I've used OpenCV, MediaPipe and Math module for made this program.

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it's used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.

Math is a built-in module that we can use for mathematical tasks.


## Required Packages:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- math


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the HandTracking.py file.
- You're done! Enjoy the hand tracking program.
